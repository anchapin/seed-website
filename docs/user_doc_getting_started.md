    ### Main screen

    After logging in to SEED, you will see the main screen

    ![](images/main_screen.png)

## Main Navigation 

The primary navigation options in SEED are shown on the left hand side
of every screen, and they can be expanded to show full titles or collapsed to just show icons.

??? note "Main Navigation"

## Inventory

The Inventory screen displays the buildings that have been imported into SEED.

??? note "Inventory"

    After building data is imported into SEED, it can be accessed from the
    Inventory navigation button. The data can be viewed by cycle, as well as
    by Property and Tax Lot.

    ![](images/inventory_property.png)

    The links at the top of the page allow different views of the data, as
    follows:

    * **Properties List:** Displays the latest version of the Properties List view

    * **Column List Profiles:** Allows creation of multiple field lists with different fields selected

    * **Cross-Cycles:** Allows viewing data across multiple cycles

    * **Map:** If the properties have been correctly geocoded, they will be displayed on a map based on those locations

    * **Data:** Links to Insights 

    * **Summary (Beta):** Displays summary information about the records and fields by cycle

## Data 

The Data navigation tab will take you to the Data Sets view, where Data
Sets (groups of imported files) can be created, and files imported. For
Energy Benchmarking and Building Performance Standards, creating data
sets based on compliance years is a standard method of organizing the
data imports.

??? note "Data"

    ![](images/data_dataSets.png)

    There are several types of data that can be imported, including

    -   Spreadsheets with one line per building, such as from Tax Assessor
        data or real estate data

    -   ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager data for one or more buildings with
        Annual Energy Data

    -   ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager data for one or more buildings with
        Monthly Energy Data

    -   GeoJSON data for spatial data information, such as latitude and
        longitude

    -   Data from the DOE tool Audit Template or Asset Score (via the
        BuildingSync format)

     ![](images/data_upload.png)

     It is also possible to upload meter data from the same file, such as an ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager file that has monthly meter data, using the Meter Data tab

## Insights 

The Insights feature in SEED allows analysis of building energy benchmarking or Building
Performance Standards compliance over time based on setting performance
targets into the future and showing how buildings are meeting those
targets, both individually and as a group, over specific time periods.

??? note "Insights"

    **Program Overview** shows the compliance of a portfolio of buildings over time. In the example below, compliance is shown over a 5 year time period, 2019 - 2023, with the compliance of the buildings increasing during that period. The red column areas show non-compliance and the blue column areas show compliance.

    ![](images/insights_programOverview.png)

    **Property Insights** shows compliance of individual buildings for a
    particular period of time (cycle), where the blue dots indicate buildings that have met their compliance targets,
    and the red triangles indicate buildings that have not met their
    targets, with the "whisker line" showing the distance from compliance
    for those buildings.

    ![](images/insights_propertyInsights.png)

    **Custom Reports** shows compliance trends, compared to a target,
    over time in a graph

    ![](images/insights_customReport.png)

## Analyses 

The Analyses feature has many different analysis options, including the
following:

- BSyncr
- BETTER
- EUI
- Average Annual CO2
- Energy Equity & Environmental Justice (EEEJ)
